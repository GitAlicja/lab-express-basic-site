        <h1>Avishai Cohen</h1>
        <p>Avishai Cohen, born in Kabri, Israel on April 20th, 1970, grew up in a multicultural family whose roots were
            found in Spain, Greece and Poland. At home, music was always in the air, with his mother Ora, an artistic
            influence, listening to both classical and traditional music.</p>
        <p>Avishaiâ€™s musical journey began when he was nine years old, when he began playing the piano. After moving to
            St. Louis, Missouri with his family aged fourteen, he continued to study the piano and began to play the
            bass guitar. The electric bass put a spell on him when his teacher introduced him to the music of luminary
            bassist Jaco Pastorius. Back in Israel, Avishai joined the Music and Arts Academy in Jerusalem to further
            explore the bass universe.</p>
        <p>At the age of 22, having served for two years in an army band, he decided to take a big step and moved to New
            York city.</p>
